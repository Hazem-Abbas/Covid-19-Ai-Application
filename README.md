This project involves training and evaluating multiple deep-learning models on a face mask detection dataset to identify the best-performing model.
The selected model was then deployed in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application for easy use. The user can choose between using a live camera, an image, or a video.
The application can detect whether faces are wearing a mask, or not, or wearing it incorrectly in real-time, helping to promote public safety and awareness.
